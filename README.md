Snake game built with Rust

## Purpose
When I learn a new language the first project I build is a game of Snake! This usually tackles several
different facets of the language, such as I/O, logic, structure, etc. 

This time I'm doing it in Rust!! 

The game can be compiled and run using Rust tooling, and can be played with the WASD keys.
